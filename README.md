# Hi there 👋 I'm William 
🏠 Based in **Stockholm, Sweden**

## About Me
I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building things for the web. Currently specialised in JavaScript, but always looking to broaden my skills and explore new technologies. I'm driven by curiosity and collaboration — I love coding solo with a nice cup of coffee ☕, but I also thrive when working with people.

## My Journey
🎓 I started my development journey at **Chas Academy**, and since then, I've had the opportunity to grow through hands-on experience:
- 🔧 **Fullstack Developer & Team Lead** at **Carelyo** — Started as an intern and grew into managing and onboarding new interns
- 🌿 **Fullstack Developer & Mentor** at **Vakansa** *(current)* — Working as a developer while mentoring our interns
  
## What I'm Up To
- 🔭 Currently working at **Vakansa** as a developer and mentor
- 🌱 Expanding beyond JavaScript to broaden my full-stack competence
- 🤝🏼 Always open to collaborating on interesting projects
- ⚡ Check out my latest project — [**Four Phases of React 🗻⚔️🥋**](https://github.com/William0209/Four_Trials_Of_React) — a template designed to help you learn React through hands-on trials, with theoretical concepts covered along the way
